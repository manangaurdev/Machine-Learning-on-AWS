    "Amazon Nova video understanding capabilities support Multi-Aspect Ratio. All videos are resized with distortion (up or down, based on the input) to 672*672 square dimensions before feeding it to the model. The model utilizes a dynamic sampling strategy based on the length of the video. For videos less than or equal to 16 minutes in duration, a 1 frame per second (FPS) sampling rate is employed. However, for videos exceeding 16 minutes in length, the sampling rate decreases in order to maintain a consistent 960 frames sampled, with the frame sampling rate varying accordingly. This approach is designed to provide more accurate scene-level video understanding for shorter videos compared to longer video content. We recommend that you keep the video length less than 1 hour for low motion, and less than 16 minutes for anything with higher motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be no difference when analyzing a 4k version of a video and a Full HD version. Similarly, because the sampling rate is at most 1 FPS, a 60 FPS video should perform as well as a 30 FPS video. Because of the 1GB limit in video size, using higher than required resolution and FPS is not beneficial and will limit the video length that fits in that size limit. You might want to pre-process videos longer than 1GB.\n",
